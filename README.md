# DAIM

DAIM as a logically distributed control plane for SDN

This research aims at developing a new distributed active information model (DAIM) to allow programmability of network elements and local decision-making process that will essentially contribute to complex distributed networks. 
DAIM offers adaptation algorithms embedded with intelligent information objects to be applied to such complex systems. 
By applying the DAIM model and these adaptation algorithms, managing complex systems in any distributed network environment can become scalable, adaptable and robust. 
The DAIM model is integrated into the SDN architecture at the level of switches to provide a logically distributed control plane that can manage the flow setups. 
The proposal moves the computational load to the switches, which allows them to adapt dynamically according to real-time demands and needs. 
The DAIM model can enhance information objects and network devices to make their local decisions through its active performance, and thus significantly reduce the workload of a centralised SDN/OpenFlow controller.
